# Sonar FPGA Metrics Plugin  

A SonarQube plugin allowing to create custom metrics and assign them values from external files. 

# Building and installing  

Build the plugin with :   
mvn clean package  
Copy the generated jar file from /target to "Sonarqube server path"/extensions/plugins , then launch Sonarqube.   

# Usage

All custom metrics should be defined in a unique 'format-metrics.json' file.  

By default src/main/resources/fpgametrics/fomat-metrics.json is used to define the list of metrics.

"Domain" field is optional. Metrics are automaticaly placed as "undefined" but its allowed to use a custom metric with an existing domain like "Maintenability". 

Pay attention, case is sensitive.

Measures for each custom metric should be defined in a file named 'measures.json' at the root of the analyzed project, when they relate to a project.

PERCENT and FLOAT types coud be used with a tab [current_value, max_value].

Metrics are grouped by unit. Coverage measure (PERCENT) and number of lines of code (INT) could not be displayed in the same graph.

Only two graphs could be displayed, for instance it's not permitted to display nb of LOC, coverage and security rating in the same time.

A warning could appear when you are trying to display a third type of measure graph like this:
- Graph 1 measures unit = INT
- Graph 2 measures unit = PERCENT
- Graph 3 measures = Security Rating

When measures relate to a single file, they should be in a json file named [Source file name without extension]_measures.json, in the same folder as the corresponding file.    

Measures will be imported in Sonarqube user interface after executing sonar-scanner. When a measure is not provided for a metric, this one is not displayed in Sonarqube user interface.


# Examples

format-metrics.json file :   


{
	"metrics": {
		"Metric1": {
			"name": "Metric 1",
			"type": "FLOAT"
		},
		"Metric2": {
			"name": "Metric 2",
			"type": "INT"
		},
		"Metric3": {
			"name": "Metric 4",
			"type": "PERCENT",
			"domain":"Maintenability"
		},
		"Metric4": {
			"name": "Metric 5",
			"type": "FLOAT",
			"domain":"custom"
		},
		"Metric5": {
			"name": "Metric 6",
			"type": "PERCENT",
			"domain":"custom"
		},
		"Metric6": {
			"name": "Metric 7",
			"type": "MILLISEC"
		},
		"Metric7": {
			"name": "Metric 8",
			"type": "RATING"
		},
		"Metric8": {
			"name": "Metric 9",
			"type": "WORK_DUR"
		},
		"Metric9": {
			"name": "Metric 10",
			"type": "BOOL"
		}
	}
}


measures.json file :   

{
	"Metric1": 80,
	"Metric2": 10,
	"Metric3": [60, 200],
	"Metric4": [400, 1000],
	"Metric5": 70,
	"Metric6": 20,
	"Metric7": 30,
	"Metric8": 55,
	"Metric9": true
}   


# Tips

To ensure storing parameters, the activity graph URL could be saved in favorite, thank to the link which contains all metrics information.
